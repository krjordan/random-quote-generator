This is the source code for a tutorial I wrote using flexbox for the layout. This page displays a random quote using the [Forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/) API. Check out my [blog post](http://mycodingblog.com/)

To download the source code you should run the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/krjordan/random-quote-generator.git
$ cd random-quote-generator && npm install
```

It helps if you have node installed to download normalize.css. If not, no worries, just got to [this repo](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) and click `Download` to `copy` & `paste` the source code into your own `normalize.css` file. Once completed, don't forget to change the path to `normalize.css` in the html `<head></head>`.

After you have downloaded `normalize.css` open up the `index.html` in a browser to view it. You can also play around with it on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/krjordan/full/oXRQXG/).
